                    The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is an American trijet wide-body aircraft first introduced by American Airlines in 1971. It was designed to succeed the DC-8 for long-range flights.<br><br>
                    The trijet had two turbofans on underwing pylons and a third one at the base of the vertical stabilizer. It had a typical seating capacity for 270 passengers in two classes. The DC-10 came in various models, including the DC-10-10, DC-10-15, DC-10-30, and DC-10-40, each with different ranges.<br><br>
                    The DC-10 also served as the basis for the KC-10 Extender, a tanker aircraft operated by the United States Air Force.<br><br>
                    The DC-10's development was influenced by the need to compete in the widebody aircraft market and pressure to produce a widebody aircraft quickly.
