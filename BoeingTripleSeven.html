                    The Boeing 777, commonly referred to as the Triple Seven, is an American long-range wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The 777 is the world's largest twinjet and the most-built wide-body airliner.<br><br>
                    The Triple Seven can accommodate a ten-abreast seating layout and has a typical 3-class capacity of 301 to 368 passengers, with a range of 5,240 to 8,555 nautical miles (9,700 to 15,840 km). The 777 is known for its large-diameter turbofan engines, fully circular fuselage cross-section, and fly-by-wire controls.<br><br>
                    In the early 1970s, Boeing unveiled the concept of the 777 to compete with wide-body trijets like the DC-10 and L-1011. The 777 program was launched in October 1990, and it has been a successful wide-body aircraft.
